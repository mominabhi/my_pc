                    <p>Scholastica was established in 1977 by Mrs. Yasmeen Murshed. It was founded with a mission to
                        provide a balanced and well-rounded education for all of our students, using English as the
                        primary medium of instruction but placing equal emphasis on Bangla. Scholastica's mission is to
                        build curious, knowledgeable and caring young individuals, who will be equipped to tackle
                        head-on the challenges of our modern-day "global village". They will aspire to become
                        responsible citizens, who will embrace and respect people from other cultures and walks of life,
                        and contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
